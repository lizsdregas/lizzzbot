#####Slackbot project

###My slackbot (lizzzbot) responds to:

if it hears "cat", it will send a random picture of a cat (it's cute)

if it hears "beyonce", it will send a picture of lemonade (because beyonce)

if you ask "is it friday yet?", it will respond based on the current day of the week

if you ask the bot (you must mention the bot) "who programmed you?" it will respond with my name
